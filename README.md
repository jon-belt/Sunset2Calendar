This project is a chome extension that allows the user to add/remove sunset/sunrise times to their google calendar!  Currently it has a working front end, allowing the user to select sunrises, sunsets, and geographical location utlisiing geolocation features.

The API key is not hidden, but I'm assuming and taking a risk that no one, especially no one malicious, will look at this repository until I configure a backend/proxy server.  If anyone is viewing this, so be it - I will be changing the API key when I finish the project regardless.
